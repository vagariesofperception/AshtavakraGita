Ashtavakra said --
A man of pure intellect realizes the Self even by instruction casually imparted.
A man of impure intellect is bewildered in trying to realize the Self even after
enquiring throughout life.

Non-attachment for sense-objects is liberation; love for sense-objects is
bondage. Such verily is Knowledge. Now do as you please.
%
This knowledge of the Truth makes an eloquent, wise and active person mute,
inert and inactive. Therefore it is shunned by those who want to enjoy the world.
%
You are not the body, nor is the body yours; you are not the doer nor the
enjoyer. You are Consciousness itself, the Eternal Witness, and free. Get about
happily.
%
Attachment and abhorrence are attributes of the mind. The mind is never
yours. You are Intelligence itself, free from conflict, and changeless. Get about
happily.
%
Realizing the Self in all and all in the Self, free from egoism and free from the
sense of ‘mine,’ be you happy.
%
You are indeed That in which the universe manifests itself like waves on the
ocean. O you Intelligence, be you free from the fever of the mind.
%
Have faith, my son, have faith. Never confuse yourself in this. You are
Knowledge itself, you are the Lord, you are the Self, and you are beyond Nature.
%
The body, composed of the ingredients of nature, comes, stays and goes. The
Self neither comes nor goes. Why, then, do you mourn it?
%
Let the body last to the end of kalpa (cycle) or let it go even today. Where is
there any increase or decrease in you who are Pure Intelligence?
%
In you who are the infinite Ocean, let the waves of the universe rise or fall
according to their own nature. That means no gain or loss to you.
%
My child, you are Pure Intelligence itself. This universe is nothing different
from you. Therefore how and where can anyone have the idea of acceptance or
rejection?
%
From where will there be birth, action and even egoism for you who are One,
immutable, calm, stainless, and Pure Consciousness?
%
You alone appear as whatever you perceive. Do bracelets, armlets and
anklets appear different from gold?
%
Completely give up such distinctions as ‘I am He’ and ‘I am not this.’
Consider all as the Self and be desireless and happy.
%
It is through your ignorance alone that the universe exists. In reality you are
One. There is no individual self or Supreme Self other than you.
%
One who knows for certain that this universe is but an illusion and a nothing,
becomes desireless and Pure Intelligence, and finds peace as if nothing exists.
%
In the ocean of the world One only was, is and will be. You have neither
bondage nor liberation. Live contented and happily.
%
O Pure Intelligence, do not disturb your mind with affirmations and
negations. Be calm and abide happily in your own self which is Bliss itself.
%
Completely give up even contemplation and hold nothing in your mind. You
are verily the Self, free. What will you do by thinking?
