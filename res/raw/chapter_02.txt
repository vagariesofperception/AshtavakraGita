Janaka said -- Oh, I am spotless, tranquil, Pure Consciousness, and beyond Nature. All this
time I have been mocked by illusion.
%
As I alone reveal this body, even so do I reveal this universe. Therefore mine
is all this universe, or verily nothing is mine.
%
Oh, having renounced the universe together with the body, I now perceive
the Supreme Self through the secret of wisdom.
%
As waves, foam and bubbles are not different from water, so the universe
emanating from the Self is not different from It.
%
As cloth, when analyzed, is found to be nothing but thread, so this universe,
when analyzed, is nothing but the Self.
%
Just as sugar generated in sugarcane juice is wholly pervaded by that juice, so
the universe produced in Me is permeated by Me through and through.
%
The world appears from the ignorance of the Self and disappears with the
knowledge of the Self, just as the snake appears from the non-cognition of the rope
and disappears with its recognition.
%
Light is my very nature and I am no other than light. When the universe
manifests itself, verily then it is I that shine.
%
O, the universe appears in me, conceived through ignorance, just as silver
appears in the mother of pearl, a snake in the rope, and water in the sunbeam.
%
Just as a jug dissolves into clay, a wave into water, or a bracelet into gold, so
the universe which has emanated from me will dissolve into me.
%
Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who know no decay and survive even
the destruction of the world, from Brahma down to a clump of grass.
%
Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who, though with a body, am One,
who neither go anywhere nor come from anywhere but abide pervading the
universe.
%
Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself! There is none so capable as I, who am
bearing the universe for all eternity without touching it with the body.
%
Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who have nothing or have all that is
thought and spoken of.
% 
Knowledge, knower and the knowable –- these three do not exist in reality. I
am that stainless Self in which this triad appears through ignorance.
%
Oh, the root of misery is duality. There is no other remedy for it except the
realization that all objects of experience are unreal and that I am pure, One,
Consciousness, and Bliss.
%
I am pure Consciousness. Through ignorance I have imposed limitations
upon myself. Constantly reflecting in this way, I am abiding in the Absolute.
%
I have neither bondage nor freedom. Having lost its support, the illusion has
ceased. Oh, the universe, though existing in me, does not in reality so exist.
%
I have known for certain that the body and the universe are nothing and that
the Atman is Pure Consciousness alone. So on what is it now possible to base
imagination?
%
Body, heaven and hell, bondage and freedom, as also fear, all these are mere
imagination.
What have I to do with all these—I whose nature is Pure
Consciousness?
%
Oh, I do not find any duality. Even the multitude of human beings, therefore,
has become like a wilderness. To what should I attach myself?
%
I am not this body, nor have I a body. I am not Jiva, I am Pure Consciousness.
This indeed was my bondage that I had thirst for life.
%
Oh, in me, the limitless ocean, on the rising of the wind of the mind, diverse
waves of worlds are produced forthwith.
%
With the calming of the wind of the mind in the infinite ocean of myself, the
ark of the universe, unfortunately for Jiva, the trader, meets destruction.
%
How wonderful! In me, the shoreless ocean, the waves of individual selves,
according to their nature, rise, strike each other, play for a time and disappear.
