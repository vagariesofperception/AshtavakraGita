Having known yourself as really indestructible and One, how is it that you,
knower of Self and serene, feel attached to the acquisition of wealth?
%
Alas, as greed arises from the illusion of silver caused by the ignorance of the
mother of pearl, even so arises attachment to the objects of illusory perception from
the ignorance of the Self.
%
Having known yourself to be That in which the universe appears like waves
on the sea, why do you run about like a miserable being?
%
After hearing oneself to be Pure Consciousness and surpassingly beautiful,
how can one yet be deeply attached to sensual objects and thus become impure?
%
It is strange that the sense of ownership should still continue in the wise one
who has realized the Self in all, and all in the Self!
%
It is strange that one abiding in the supreme non-duality and intent on
liberation should yet be subject to lust and weakened by the practice of amorous
pastimes!
%
It is strange that knowing lust to be an enemy of Knowledge, a man who has
grown extremely weak and reached his last days, should yet be eager for sensual
enjoyment!
%
It is strange that one who is unattached to the objects of this world and the
next, who discriminates the eternal from the transient, and who longs for
emancipation, should yet fear dissolution of the body!
%
Feted and feasted or tormented, the serene person ever sees the Absolute Self
and is thus neither gratified nor angry.
%
The high-souled person witnesses his own body acting as if it were another’s.
As such, how can he be disturbed by praise or blame?
%
Realizing this universe as mere illusion and losing all curiosity, how can one
of steady mind yet fear the approach of death?
%
With whom can we compare that great-souled one, who is content with Selfknowledge and does not hanker even after liberation?
%
Why should that steady-minded one who knows the object of perception to
be in its very nature nothing, consider one thing acceptable and another
unacceptable?
%
He who has given up worldly attachment from his mind, who is beyond the
pairs of opposites, and who is free from desire — to him no experience coming as a
matter of course causes either pleasure or pain.
